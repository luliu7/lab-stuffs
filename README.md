The following R code creates graphs analyzing the data
* creating-plots.R creates Box and Whisker plots
  * All methods Percentage Training Set Sensitivity (neg vs orig)
  * All methods Percentage Redfly Recovered (neg vs orig)
  * imm only Percentage Training Set Sensitivity (neg vs orig)
  * imm only Percentage Redfly Recovered (neg vs orig)
  * Per method Percentage Training Set Sensitivity (comparing across methods)
  * Per method Percentage Redfly Recovered (comparing across methods)
  
  
  
* box and whisker (neg, orig, each method)
* % Recovery and sensitivity (neg vs orig, between each method)
